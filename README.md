<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

- This is a fork of my earlier e-commerce mockup project to deep dive into one of the most common website types.
Building a store was just to demonstrate coding, UX and marketing knowledge. There was never any product, to begin with. After reading about a technique to overlay an image with an SVG to change its color, I wanted to continue with the e-commerce idea but reduce it's complexity and just "sell" one thing. 


### Basics
- Landing page and color search
- Store page
- Authentication
- Navigation
- Wishlist, shopping cart and checkout

### UX
- Distraction-free signup and login process 
- A streamlined checkout flow with guest checkout
- In-depth navigation and accessible search
- Enabling the different types of shoppers in their jobs-to-be-done (product-focused, browsers, researchers, bargain hunters, one-time shoppers)

### Marketing
- Creating desire with product presentation and benefit-oriented descriptions on the landing page
- Nudges towards signups, items added to the shopping card with modals and reciprocity/scarcity/loss aversion  
- Social proof through user reviews

### Development
- fast loading landing page
- image-fetching and caching
- user authentication 
- mobile-first development


<!-- Current challenges -->

## Current challenges

- A unique and interesting site layout, which can adapt to different situations and areas of focus
- The search-input component behaves differently on actual mobile phones compared to the chrome dev tools
- Animating height, when the dimensions of the last step are not set


<!-- Learnings -->

## What I learned so far

- I really got into performant animations and worked with techniques like FLIP (First, Last, Invert, Play) and requestAnimationFrame to get a smooth transition if there are height changes, etc.
