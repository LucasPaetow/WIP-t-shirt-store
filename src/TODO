Main-Layout needs dedicated padding-top and row-gap

Modals
=> Vue Portal for 1 Modal und 1 Alert
- "Pick a Color" modal (Store, )
- "Register" Modal after order completion
- "Choose Size" from different places (Store,)


Modal Problems
- There is no separation of animations for the background and forground
- Only a very basic transition animation without full animation duration and cubicBezier control
- Top closebutton has to be hidden during transition because its not part of the transition but affected
- Headline is sometimes not very well sized because only the headline
- A secondary button is missing (maybe "choose another color")?

//////////////
=> Workaround: A fixed button container with overflow none width 2/3 components inside and already rendered. On click they just move in and out of the container viewbox
