Home page
- Change Picture Sections into scroll container, where colors scroll through and change the t-shirts color.
- Either go to another container with a new image or have the image change to a new one

- On focus everything else fades away, so there is no distraction

Modal Problems
- There is no separation of animations for the background and forground
- Only a very basic transition animation without full animation duration and cubicBezier control
- Top closebutton has to be hidden during transition because its not part of the transition but affected
- Headline is sometimes not very well sized because only the headline
- A secondary button is missing (maybe "choose another color")?
