Home page
- add more images with 2-3 colors each (3 images in total?)
- maybe additional reasons besides color?

Store-page
- make wishlist-button functional
  -- Heart-Icon, which gets filled?

Image-Overlay:
- Positioning des overlays (wie objectPosition) => difficult, maybe with the viewbox ? preserveAspectRatio only for very basic changes


Cart
- Save cart locally

Checkout
-- Base view with progression


Navbar
- Create full navbar


Modal Problems
- There is no separation of animations for the background and forground
- Only a very basic transition animation without full animation duration and cubicBezier control
- Top closebutton has to be hidden during transition because its not part of the transition but affected
- Headline is sometimes not very well sized because only the headline
- A secondary button is missing (maybe "choose another color")?
