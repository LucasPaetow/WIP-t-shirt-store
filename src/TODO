######### Components ############

Search-Component
- Show results on mobile while typing


Inputs
- turn radiobuttons into components

Buttons
- Define primary, secondary, tertiary, no-styling
- Dumb buttons should have the option for a logo

Image-Overlay:
- Positioning des overlays (wie objectPosition) => difficult, maybe with the viewbox ? preserveAspectRatio only for very basic changes
- loadingState

Navbar
- Create full navbar


Modal screens:
- Color chooser



Modal Problems
- There is no separation of animations for the background and forground
- Only a very basic transition animation without full animation duration and cubicBezier control
- Top closebutton has to be hidden during transition because its not part of the transition but affected
- Headline is sometimes not very well sized because only the headline
- A secondary button is missing (maybe "choose another color")?

//////////////
=> Workaround: A fixed button container with overflow none width 2/3 components inside and already rendered. On click they just move in and out of the container viewbox
///////////////

Cleanup:
-- Separate components in dumb and smart
-- Colors are moved in Arrays, object would be nicer
